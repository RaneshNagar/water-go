    <h2>Why Save Water?</h2>
    <p>Water is a precious resource essential for all life forms. By saving water, we help protect ecosystems and ensure that aquatic creatures thrive.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Importance of Aquatic Life</h2>
    <p>Aquatic creatures play a vital role in maintaining the health of our planet. They contribute to biodiversity and help regulate our environment.</p>
</section>

<section class="creature-info">
    <h2>Water Creatures and Their Importance</h2>
    <p>Here are some key aquatic creatures and their roles in the ecosystem:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fish:</strong> They are vital for food webs, providing food for predators and maintaining ecological balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Turtles:</strong> They help control jellyfish populations and maintain healthy seagrass beds, which are crucial for marine ecosystems.</li>
        <li><strong>Corals:</strong> These creatures build reefs that provide habitat for thousands of marine species and protect coastlines from erosion.</li>
        <li><strong>Frogs:</strong> As both predators and prey, they play a critical role in controlling insect populations and indicate ecosystem health.</li>
        <li><strong>Dolphins:</strong> They are intelligent predators that help maintain the balance of marine life and are key indicators of ocean health.</li>
        <li><strong>Shark</strong> These are at the top of the food chain, and they help maintain the balance of marine ecosystems by controlling the populations of other species, particularly prey fish and marine mammals. This predatory behavior prevents any one species from dominating the ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="5 Wonders Of Water That You May know">
<h2>Wonders of Water</h2>
<p>Here are 7 wonders of water</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Bermuda Triangle</strong> often referred to as the "Devil's Triangle," is a region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is famous for a number of aircraft and ships allegedly disappearing under mysterious circumstances while traveling through the area</li>
<li><strong>Mariana Trench</strong> the deepest oceanic trench in the world. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it reaches a maximum depth of about 36,000 feet (around 10,984 meters) at its deepest point, known as the Challenger Deep. This vast underwater canyon is formed by the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Mariana Plate, resulting in an extreme environment with immense pressure, near-freezing temperatures, and complete darkness.</li>
<li><strong>The Great Barrier Reff</strong>
    As the largest coral reef system on Earth, the Great Barrier Reef spans over 1,400 miles along Australia’s northeast coast. It hosts a breathtaking diversity of marine life, including over 1,500 fish species, colorful corals, sea turtles, and marine mammals. The reef's vibrant ecosystems are considered one of the seven natural wonders of the world and are visible from space​</li>
<li><Strong>Orda cave</Strong> is one of the world’s largest underwater gypsum caves, located in the Perm Krai region of Russia. Stretching over 5 kilometers (about 3.1 miles), the cave includes approximately 4.8 kilometers (around 3 miles) of flooded passages. Known for its stunning clarity, the cave's water is filtered through gypsum, providing visibility of up to 50 meters (about 164 feet). This crystal-clear quality allows divers to experience an almost surreal underwater landscape of gypsum formations and intricate tunnels.</li>
<li><<strong>Tamu Massif</strong>The largest underwater volcano is Tamu Massif, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It covers an area of about 553,000 square kilometers (214,000 sq mi), making it larger than any volcano on land.
